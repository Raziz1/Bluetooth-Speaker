 PCB design for a custom bluetooth speaker

Design Challenges
* For class D audio amplifiers less than 5 watts you can get away with powering them through a single 18650 3.7V cell because they can typically operate between 2.5 - 5.5V.
* If you require a class D audio amplifier greater than 5 watts you will require a higher supply voltage range meaning your battery cell configuration will likely have to be a larger series configuration. Once you have a battery configuration with a supply voltage larger than 5V your standard USB-C configuration will no longer be able to charge it. You will require a power delivery IC to negotiate higher voltages from the wall socket (9V, 12V, and 20V).
